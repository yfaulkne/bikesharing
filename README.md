### Purpose
##### The purpose of this module and challenge was to create an analysis for investors to potentially in a Citi Bike program for Des Moines, Iowa.  Public Citi Bike data for NYC, new York was used as a fram of refernce for the analysis. 
##### Using Tableau, we created visualizations that show the following including:

* Casual riders versus subscribers
* Average trip duration for all riders
* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

### Results
##### The below were some of the visualtions created in tableau for the analysis:

### Summary
##### The results show that the Citi Bike model works in a highly populated or tourist attraction area. Most users start and stop their trips in the Manhattan area.
##### If Des Moines is highly populated or draws a good amount of tourists during the year, then Citi Bike may do well there.
##### I would suggest two more visualizations to help investors determine if this would be a good investment:
  #####   1. A graph that shows average temperatures throughout the year in Des Moines in order to determine the best months to peak the Citi Bike subscription model.
  #####   2. A heat map that shows top populated or tourist areas in Des Moines. This will help investors determine where to place the citi bikes throughout the city.
